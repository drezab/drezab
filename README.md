## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is doug.

I enjoy learning about computers and science, and although I never finished college, I hope to return some day and learn more about neuroscience.

I've been reading and writing code in several programming languages for over a decade; I'm self taught and I really enjoy the process of learning and building new things!

Although I haven't published much of my past code and work on this github profile, I hope to use this profile to find projects that I'm passionate about and contribute to them.

Thanks for reading and visiting!

`~doug`
